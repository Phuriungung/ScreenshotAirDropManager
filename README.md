# ScreenshotAirDropManager
This project is a macOS application that automates the process of sharing the latest PNG screenshot file via AirDrop. It utilizes the Cocoa framework and implements the NSApplicationDelegate protocol.

Upon launching, the application searches for PNG files in the "Screenshots" folder located on the user's desktop. It sorts the files based on their modification date, with the most recent file being selected. If a PNG file is found, the application initiates an AirDrop transfer of the file to nearby devices. If no PNG files are found, a message is printed indicating the absence of files in the designated folder.

The application is designed to automatically terminate after 60 seconds to streamline the process. It also supports secure restorable state and terminates when the last window is closed.

To enhance the efficiency of the macOS application and make it even faster to use, you can consider incorporating keyboard bindings using tools like skhd and Raycast. 

This project simplifies the task of sharing screenshots by eliminating the need for manual selection and AirDrop initiation, providing a more efficient and convenient solution.
